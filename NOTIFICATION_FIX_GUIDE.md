# 🔔 Driver Notification System - Fix & Testing Guide

## ✅ Problem Identified & Fixed

### **Root Cause:**
Drivers were not receiving notifications because their **vehicle types were not set** or were **invalid**.

### **What Was Wrong:**
1. **drivertest1**: Had NO vehicle type set (`vehicleType: undefined`)
2. **drivertest2**: Had vehicle type "Auto" (valid)
3. **Other drivers**: Had NO vehicle type set

When customers created orders with vehicle type "Bike", the backend looked for drivers with `vehicleType: "Bike"`, but found none because:
- drivertest1 had no vehicle type
- drivertest2 had "Auto" (not "Bike")

### **Solution Applied:**
✅ Ran `autoFixDrivers.js` script to set vehicle types for all drivers
✅ All drivers now have valid vehicle types from: `["Bike", "Auto", "Mini Truck", "Large Truck"]`

## 📊 Current Driver Status

After running the fix script:

| Driver Name | Email | Vehicle Type | On Duty | Approved | Will Receive Notifications? |
|------------|-------|--------------|---------|----------|----------------------------|
| drivertest1 | drivertest1@gmail.com | **Bike** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ **YES** (for Bike orders) |
| drivertest2 | drivertest2@gmail.com | **Auto** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ **YES** (for Auto orders) |
| Driver One | driver1@example.com | **Bike** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (not on duty) |
| Driver1 | driver1@test.com | **Bike** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (not on duty) |
| Admin | admin120@example.com | **Bike** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (not on duty) |

## 🧪 How to Test Notifications

### **Test 1: Bike Order Notification**

1. **Login as drivertest1** (drivertest1@gmail.com)
   - Ensure you're **ON DUTY** (toggle should be green)
   - Keep the dashboard open
   - Open browser console (F12) to see logs

2. **Create a Bike order** (as customer or admin):
   - Login as customer or admin
   - Create new order
   - Select vehicle type: **"Bike"**
   - Fill in pickup/dropoff addresses
   - Submit order

3. **Expected Result:**
   - ✅ drivertest1 should see a notification card
   - ✅ Browser console should show: `"🔔 RAW order notification received"`
   - ✅ Backend console should show: `"✅ Notified driver drivertest1 (Bike) via socket"`

### **Test 2: Auto Order Notification**

1. **Login as drivertest2** (drivertest2@gmail.com)
   - Ensure you're **ON DUTY**
   - Keep dashboard open
   - Open browser console

2. **Create an Auto order**:
   - Select vehicle type: **"Auto"**
   - Submit order

3. **Expected Result:**
   - ✅ drivertest2 should see notification
   - ✅ drivertest1 should NOT see notification (different vehicle type)

### **Test 3: Multiple Drivers Same Vehicle Type**

1. **Login as Driver One** (driver1@example.com)
   - Go **ON DUTY**
   - Vehicle type is now "Bike"

2. **Keep drivertest1 also ON DUTY**

3. **Create a Bike order**

4. **Expected Result:**
   - ✅ Both drivertest1 AND Driver One should receive notification
   - ✅ First driver to accept gets the order
   - ✅ Other driver sees "Order accepted by another driver"

## 🔍 Debugging Checklist

If notifications still don't work, check:

### **Frontend (Driver Dashboard):**
1. ✅ Driver is logged in
2. ✅ Driver is ON DUTY (green toggle)
3. ✅ Browser console shows: `"✅ Socket connected: [socket-id]"`
4. ✅ Browser console shows: `"📋 Driver details:"` with correct vehicle type
5. ✅ No JavaScript errors in console

### **Backend (Server Console):**
1. ✅ Server shows: `"👤 Driver registered: [driver-id] (Socket ID: [socket-id])"`
2. ✅ Server shows: `"🚗 Driver added to connectedDrivers map"`
3. ✅ When order created, shows: `"📢 Found X drivers with [vehicle-type] vehicle type"`
4. ✅ Shows: `"✅ Notified driver [name] ([vehicle-type]) via socket [socket-id]"`

### **Database:**
1. ✅ Driver document has `isApproved: true`
2. ✅ Driver document has `approvalStatus: "Approved"`
3. ✅ Driver document has `isOnDuty: true`
4. ✅ Driver document has `driverDetails.vehicleType` set to valid type

## 🛠️ Manual Fix for Individual Driver

If you need to manually set a driver's vehicle type:

### **Option 1: Using MongoDB Compass**
1. Open MongoDB Compass
2. Connect to your database
3. Go to `delivery_app` database → `users` collection
4. Find the driver document
5. Edit `driverDetails.vehicleType` to one of: `"Bike"`, `"Auto"`, `"Mini Truck"`, `"Large Truck"`
6. Save

### **Option 2: Using MongoDB Shell**
```javascript
db.users.updateOne(
  { email: "driver@example.com" },
  { $set: { "driverDetails.vehicleType": "Bike" } }
)
```

### **Option 3: Using the Fix Script**
```bash
node backend/fixDriverVehicleTypes.js
```
(Interactive script - asks for each driver)

## 📝 Valid Vehicle Types

The system supports these vehicle types:
- ✅ **"Bike"** - Two-wheeler
- ✅ **"Auto"** - Auto-rickshaw
- ✅ **"Mini Truck"** - Small commercial vehicle (500kg capacity)
- ✅ **"Large Truck"** - Heavy goods vehicle (2000kg capacity)

**Note:** Vehicle types are **case-sensitive**. Must match exactly.
