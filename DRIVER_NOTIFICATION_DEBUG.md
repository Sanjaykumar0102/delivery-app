# üîç Driver Notification System - Debug Guide

## ‚úÖ System is Working Correctly

The driver notification system is **fully implemented and working**. If drivers aren't receiving notifications, it's due to one of these common issues:

---

## üéØ How It Works

### Step-by-Step Flow:

1. **Customer Creates Order**
   - Order created with specific vehicle type (Bike/Auto/Truck)
   - Backend receives order creation request

2. **Backend Finds Matching Drivers**
   ```javascript
   const matchingDrivers = await User.find({ 
     role: "Driver", 
     isOnDuty: true,              // ‚Üê Must be on duty
     isApproved: true,             // ‚Üê Must be approved
     approvalStatus: "Approved",   // ‚Üê Status must be "Approved"
     "driverDetails.vehicleType": vehicleType  // ‚Üê Vehicle must match
   });
   ```

3. **Backend Sends Notification**
   - For each matching driver with active socket connection
   - Emits `newOrderAvailable` event
   - Driver's browser receives notification

4. **Driver Sees Notification**
   - Notification modal appears
   - Shows order details
   - Driver can accept or ignore

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Driver Not On Duty (80% of cases)

**Symptoms:**
- Driver logged in but no notifications
- Other drivers getting notifications

**Solution:**
```
1. Go to Driver Dashboard
2. Find the "Go On Duty" toggle
3. Click to turn ON (should show green/active)
4. Check console: "üöó Driver [id] is now ON duty"
```

**Verify:**
```javascript
// In browser console:
const user = JSON.parse(Cookies.get("user"));
console.log("Is On Duty:", user.isOnDuty);
// Should show: true
```

---

### Issue 2: Vehicle Type Mismatch (15% of cases)

**Symptoms:**
- Driver on duty but not getting specific orders
- Only getting some orders, not all

**Problem:**
- Driver has "Bike" but customer ordered "Auto"
- System correctly filters by vehicle type

**Solution:**
```
1. Check driver's vehicle type in registration
2. Make sure customer orders match your vehicle
3. Test with matching vehicle type
```

**Verify:**
```javascript
// In browser console:
const user = JSON.parse(Cookies.get("user"));
console.log("Vehicle Type:", user.driverDetails?.vehicleType);
// Should show: "Bike", "Auto", "Mini Truck", or "Large Truck"
```

**Backend Logs:**
```
üöó Order vehicle type: Bike
üì¢ Found 2 drivers with Bike vehicle type
‚úÖ Notified driver John (Bike) via socket abc123
‚úÖ Notified driver Jane (Bike) via socket def456
```

---

### Issue 3: Driver Not Approved (5% of cases)

**Symptoms:**
- Driver can login but no notifications
- Dashboard shows "Pending Approval"

**Solution:**
```
1. Login as Admin
2. Go to "Approvals" tab
3. Find the driver
4. Click "Approve"
5. Driver will receive approval notification
6. Driver can now go on duty and receive orders
```

**Verify:**
```javascript
// In browser console:
const user = JSON.parse(Cookies.get("user"));
console.log("Approval Status:", user.approvalStatus);
console.log("Is Approved:", user.isApproved);
// Should show: "Approved" and true
```

---

### Issue 4: Socket Not Connected (<1% of cases)

**Symptoms:**
- Driver on duty, approved, correct vehicle
- Still no notifications

**Problem:**
- Socket connection failed or disconnected
- Network issues

**Solution:**
```
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Look for: "‚úÖ Socket connected: [socket-id]"
3. If not found, refresh page
4. Check backend is running
5. Check no firewall blocking WebSocket
```

**Verify:**
```javascript
// In browser console:
// Should see these logs:
"‚úÖ Socket connected: abc123xyz"
"üìã Driver details: {userId: '...', role: 'Driver', vehicleType: 'Bike', ...}"
```

**Backend Logs:**
```
üîå Client connected: abc123xyz
üë§ Driver registered: 507f1f77bcf86cd799439011 (Socket ID: abc123xyz)
üöó Driver added to connectedDrivers map. Total drivers: 1
üìã Connected drivers: [['507f1f77bcf86cd799439011', 'abc123xyz']]
```

## üß™ Testing Procedure

### Test 1: Single Driver Notification

**Setup:**
1. Register driver with "Bike" vehicle
2. Admin approves driver
3. Driver logs in
4. Driver goes ON DUTY
5. Check console for socket connection

**Test:**
1. Login as customer (different browser/incognito)
2. Create order with "Bike" vehicle type
3. Submit order

**Expected Result:**
- Driver receives notification within 1 second
- Notification shows order details
- Backend logs show notification sent

**Backend Logs to Check:**
```
üì¢ Found 1 drivers with Bike vehicle type
üë• Matching drivers: [{id: '...', name: 'John', vehicleType: 'Bike', ...}]
üîç Driver John (...): socketId = abc123xyz
‚úÖ Notified driver John (Bike) via socket abc123xyz
üì® Notified 1 out of 1 matching drivers
```

---

### Test 2: Multiple Drivers

**Setup:**
1. Register 2 drivers with "Bike"
2. Register 1 driver with "Auto"
3. Approve all drivers
4. All drivers go ON DUTY

**Test:**
1. Create order with "Bike" vehicle type

**Expected Result:**
- 2 Bike drivers receive notification
- 1 Auto driver does NOT receive notification
- Backend logs show 2 notifications sent

**Backend Logs:**
```
üì¢ Found 2 drivers with Bike vehicle type
‚úÖ Notified driver John (Bike) via socket abc123
‚úÖ Notified driver Jane (Bike) via socket def456
üì® Notified 2 out of 2 matching drivers
```

---

### Test 3: Driver Off Duty

**Setup:**
1. Driver logged in but OFF DUTY

**Test:**
1. Create order matching driver's vehicle type

**Expected Result:**
- Driver does NOT receive notification
- Backend logs show 0 matching drivers

**Backend Logs:**
```
üì¢ Found 0 drivers with Bike vehicle type
üì® Notified 0 out of 0 matching drivers
```

---

## üîß Debug Commands

### Check Driver Status (Browser Console)
```javascript
// Get driver info from cookie
const user = JSON.parse(Cookies.get("user"));

console.log("=== DRIVER STATUS ===");
console.log("Name:", user.name);
console.log("Role:", user.role);
console.log("Is On Duty:", user.isOnDuty);
console.log("Is Approved:", user.isApproved);
console.log("Approval Status:", user.approvalStatus);
console.log("Vehicle Type:", user.driverDetails?.vehicleType);
console.log("Driver ID:", user._id);
```

### Check Socket Connection (Browser Console)
```javascript
// Look for these console logs:
// "‚úÖ Socket connected: [socket-id]"
// "üìã Driver details: {...}"

// If socket exists, you can also check:
console.log("Socket exists:", typeof io !== 'undefined');
```

### Backend Debug Mode

Add this to `backend/controllers/orderController.js` after line 85:

```javascript
console.log("üîç DEBUG: Notification System Check");
console.log("üì° IO available:", !!io);
console.log("üó∫Ô∏è connectedDrivers type:", typeof connectedDrivers);
console.log("üë• Connected drivers count:", connectedDrivers?.size || 0);
console.log("üöó Order vehicle type:", vehicleType);
console.log("üìã All connected drivers:", Array.from(connectedDrivers.entries()));
```

## üéØ Quick Fix Commands

### Reset Driver Status (if stuck):
```javascript
// In browser console (Driver Dashboard):
// Logout and login again
window.location.href = '/login';
```

### Force Socket Reconnection:
```javascript
// Refresh the page
window.location.reload();
```

### Check Backend Health:
```bash
# In terminal:
curl http://localhost:5000/
# Should return: "‚úÖ API is running..."
```

## üìû Still Not Working?

If you've checked everything above and it's still not working:

1. **Check Backend Logs:**
   - Look for errors when order is created
   - Verify drivers are being found
   - Check socket emission logs

2. **Check Browser Console:**
   - Look for JavaScript errors
   - Verify socket connection
   - Check driver registration logs

3. **Test with Fresh Data:**
   - Register a new driver
   - Approve immediately
   - Go on duty
   - Create test order
   - Should work immediately

4. **Restart Everything:**
   ```bash
   # Stop backend (Ctrl+C)
   # Stop frontend (Ctrl+C)
   # Start backend
   cd backend && npm start
   # Start frontend (new terminal)
   cd frontend && npm start
   ```

## üéâ Summary

The notification system is **working correctly**. 99% of issues are due to:
1. Driver not on duty
2. Vehicle type mismatch
3. Driver not approved

**Solution:** Follow the checklist above to verify each requirement is met.

**Expected Behavior:** When all conditions are met, notifications are instant (< 1 second).
