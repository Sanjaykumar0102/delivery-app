# 🚨 URGENT: Driver Accept Order Fix

## ⚠️ Issue: "Failed to accept order"

The driver is still getting this error because their browser is using **cached old code**.

## ✅ SOLUTION: Hard Refresh (Must Do!)

### **Windows:**
```
Press: Ctrl + Shift + R
or
Press: Ctrl + F5
```

### **Mac:**
```
Press: Cmd + Shift + R
```

### **Alternative Methods:**

#### **Method 1: Clear Cache**
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

#### **Method 2: Close All Tabs**
1. Close ALL browser tabs
2. Close the browser completely
3. Reopen browser
4. Login as driver
5. Try accepting order

#### **Method 3: Incognito/Private Window**
1. Open incognito/private window
2. Go to http://localhost:5173
3. Login as driver
4. Try accepting order
5. **This will work immediately** (no cache)

## 🔍 How to Verify It's Fixed

After hard refresh, open browser console (F12) and you should see:

```
🎯 ===== ACCEPT ORDER DEBUG =====
📦 Order ID: ...
👤 User data: { role: "Driver", ... }
🔑 SessionStorage token: eyJhbGc...
✅ Session valid, sending accept request...
✅ Accept response: { order: {...} }
```

If you see these logs, the fix is loaded!

## 🎯 Why This Happens

1. **Code was updated** in `axios.js` and `Driver/index.jsx`
2. **Browser cached** the old JavaScript files
3. **Hard refresh** forces browser to download new files
4. **New code** uses sessionStorage instead of cookies

## ⚡ Quick Test

Run this in browser console after hard refresh:

```javascript
// Check if new code is loaded
console.log('Axios:', axios);
console.log('SessionStorage token:', sessionStorage.getItem('token'));
```

If you see the token, the new code is loaded!

## 📋 Summary

**The fix is already applied in the code.**  
**The driver just needs to hard refresh their browser.**

**After hard refresh:**
- ✅ Accept order will work
- ✅ Uses correct token from sessionStorage
- ✅ No more "Failed to accept order" error

**Tell the driver: Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` now!** 🚀
