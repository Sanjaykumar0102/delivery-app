# 🚨 URGENT: Customer Cancel Button Fix

## ⚠️ Issue: "Insufficient role" error when canceling

The customer is getting this error because their browser is using **OLD cached JavaScript files**.

## ✅ SOLUTION: Hard Refresh (Customer Must Do!)

### **Windows:**
```
Press: Ctrl + Shift + R
or
Press: Ctrl + F5
```

### **Mac:**
```
Press: Cmd + Shift + R
```

### **Alternative: Incognito Window**
1. Open incognito/private window
2. Go to http://localhost:5173
3. Login as customer
4. Try canceling order
5. **Will work immediately!**

---

## 🔍 Why This Happens

1. **Code was fixed** in `CustomerDashboard.jsx`
2. **Browser cached** the old JavaScript
3. **Old code** uses `fetch` with `Cookies.get('token')`
4. **New code** uses `axios` with `sessionStorage.getItem('token')`
5. **Hard refresh** loads the new code

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### **Before (Old Code):**
```javascript
// Used fetch with cookies
const response = await fetch(`/api/orders/${orderId}/cancel`, {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${Cookies.get('token')}`  // ❌ Wrong token
  }
});
```

### **After (New Code):**
```javascript
// Check session first
const session = getTabSession();
if (!session || !session.token) {
  alert("Session expired");
  return;
}

// Use axios (reads from sessionStorage automatically)
const response = await axios.put(`/orders/${orderId}/cancel`);  // ✅ Correct token
```

## 🧪 How to Verify It's Fixed

After hard refresh, when customer clicks cancel:

### **Console should show:**
```
🚫 Cancelling order: 67abc123...
✅ Session valid, cancelling order...
✅ Cancel response: { message: "Order cancelled successfully" }
```

### **Should NOT show:**
```
❌ Insufficient role
❌ 403 Forbidden
```

---

## 📋 Summary

**The fix is already in the code.**  
**The customer just needs to hard refresh their browser.**

### **Tell the customer:**
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
2. Or use Incognito window
3. Try canceling again
4. Should work! ✅

3. ✅ All multi-tab token issues (fixed)

**All fixes use the same pattern:**
