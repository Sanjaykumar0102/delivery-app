## 🔍 Troubleshooting Driver Notifications

### Driver Not Getting Notifications?

**Checklist:**
1. ✅ Driver is logged in?
2. ✅ Driver is ON DUTY? (toggle in dashboard)
3. ✅ Driver is APPROVED? (check approval status)
4. ✅ Socket connected? (check browser console for "✅ Socket connected")
5. ✅ Vehicle type matches order? (Bike driver won't get Auto orders)

**Debug Steps:**
```javascript
// In browser console (Driver Dashboard):
console.log(Cookies.get("user"));
// Should show: role: "Driver", isOnDuty: true, isApproved: true

// Check socket connection:
// Look for: "✅ Socket connected: [socket-id]"
// Look for: "📋 Driver details: {userId, role, vehicleType, isOnDuty}"
```

**Backend Logs to Check:**
```
🔍 Checking notification system...
📡 IO available: true
👥 Connected drivers map size: [number]
🚗 Order vehicle type: [type]
📢 Found [X] drivers with [type] vehicle type
✅ Notified driver [name] ([type]) via socket [id]
```
