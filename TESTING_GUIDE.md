# Testing Guide - Delivery App Issues

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Earnings Display Issue
**Problem**: Earnings showing as `₹81.98400000000000` instead of `₹104.00`

**Solution**: Added `.toFixed(2)` formatting to all earnings displays in:
- Home tab earnings summary
- Earnings tab detailed view
- Profile tab total earnings

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard/Driver/index.jsx` (lines 706, 710, 714, 718, 1098, 1102, 1106, 1110, 1147)
- `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard/Driver/DriverDashboard.css` (added word-break to .earning-amount)

### 2. 🔍 Driver Notification Debugging Enhanced
**Problem**: Notifications not appearing when customer books an order

**Solution**: Added comprehensive logging to help identify the issue:

**Backend Logging** (`backend/controllers/orderController.js`):
- IO availability check
- Connected drivers map size
- Matching drivers details (ID, name, vehicle type, duty status)
- Socket ID for each driver
- Notification success/failure for each driver

**Frontend Logging** (`frontend/src/pages/Dashboard/Driver/index.jsx`):
- Socket connection details
- Driver details (vehicle type, duty status, approval status)
- Raw notification data received
- Vehicle type matching logic
- Notification display confirmation

### 3. ✅ Customer Order Status Updates
**Problem**: Customer not receiving real-time status updates

**Solution**: Added socket event emission in `backend/controllers/orderController.js`:
- Emits `orderStatusUpdate` to customer when driver updates order status
- Includes order ID, status, and driver details
- Also broadcasts to admin dashboard

## Testing Steps

### Test 1: Earnings Display
1. Complete an order as a driver
2. Check the Home tab - earnings should show as `₹XX.XX` (2 decimal places)
3. Check the Earnings tab - all amounts should be formatted properly
4. Check the Profile tab - total earnings should be formatted

### Test 2: Driver Notification System

#### Prerequisites:
1. **Driver Setup**:
   - Register as a driver with a specific vehicle type (e.g., "Bike")
   - Wait for admin approval
   - Login as driver
   - Go online (toggle duty to ON)
   - Keep browser console open (F12)

2. **Customer Setup**:
   - Login as customer
   - Create an order with the SAME vehicle type as the driver

#### What to Check in Driver Console:
```
✅ Socket connected: [socket-id]
📋 Driver details: {
  userId: "...",
  role: "Driver",
  vehicleType: "Bike",
  isOnDuty: true,
  isApproved: true,
  approvalStatus: "Approved"
}
```

#### What to Check in Backend Console (when order is created):
```
🔍 Checking notification system...
📡 IO available: true
👥 Connected drivers map size: 1 (or more)
🚗 Order vehicle type: Bike
📢 Found 1 drivers with Bike vehicle type
👥 Matching drivers: [{ id: "...", name: "...", vehicleType: "Bike", ... }]
🔍 Driver [name] ([id]): socketId = [socket-id]
✅ Notified driver [name] (Bike) via socket [socket-id]
📨 Notified 1 out of 1 matching drivers
```

#### What to Check in Driver Browser:
```
🔔 RAW order notification received: { _id: "...", vehicleType: "Bike", ... }
👤 Current driver vehicle type: Bike
🚗 Order vehicle type: Bike
✅ SHOWING NOTIFICATION for order: [order-id]
```

#### Expected UI Behavior:
1. The "Waiting for orders..." section should DISAPPEAR
2. A notification card should APPEAR with order details
3. Accept/Reject buttons should be visible

### Test 3: Customer Status Updates

#### Setup:
1. Customer places an order
2. Driver accepts the order
3. Driver updates status: Arrived → Picked-Up → In-Transit → Delivered

#### What to Check:
- Customer should receive real-time updates via socket
- Customer UI should update automatically
- No page refresh needed

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Driver not receiving notifications

**Possible Causes**:
1. **Driver not approved**: Check `approvalStatus` in console logs
2. **Driver not on duty**: Check `isOnDuty` in console logs
3. **Vehicle type mismatch**: Check vehicle types in console logs
4. **Socket not connected**: Check socket connection in console
5. **Driver not registered in socket**: Check backend logs for "Driver registered"

**Debug Steps**:
1. Open browser console (F12) on driver dashboard
2. Check for socket connection message
3. Check driver details logged on connection
4. Create an order as customer
5. Check backend console for notification logs
6. Check driver console for notification received logs

### Issue: Earnings showing wrong format

**Solution**: Already fixed with `.toFixed(2)`. If still showing wrong:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Hard refresh (Ctrl + Shift + R)
3. Check if earnings data is a number (not string)

### Issue: "Waiting for orders" not hiding

**Current Logic** (lines 936-997 in index.jsx):
- If `availableOrders.length > 0`: Show available orders grid
- Else if `notification && showNotification`: Show notification card
- Else: Show "Waiting for orders..."

**Debug**:
1. Check `showNotification` state in React DevTools
2. Check `notification` state in React DevTools
3. Verify notification is being set in socket listener

## Files Modified

### Frontend:
1. `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard/Driver/index.jsx`
   - Added earnings formatting with `.toFixed(2)`
   - Enhanced socket connection logging
   - Enhanced notification received logging

2. `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard/Driver/DriverDashboard.css`
   - Added word-break to `.earning-amount` class

### Backend:
1. `backend/controllers/orderController.js`
   - Enhanced notification system logging
   - Added customer status update socket emission
   - Added detailed driver matching logs

2. `backend/controllers/userController.js`
   - Enhanced `getProfile` to fetch fresh data from database

## Next Steps

1. **Test the notification system** with the enhanced logging
2. **Share the console logs** if notifications still don't work
3. **Verify vehicle types match** between driver and order
4. **Ensure driver is approved and on duty**
5. **Check socket connection** is established

## Important Notes

- Notifications auto-hide after 30 seconds
- Only approved, on-duty drivers with matching vehicle type receive notifications
- Driver must be connected via socket to receive notifications
- Earnings are calculated as 80% of fare (20% platform fee)
- All earnings are now formatted to 2 decimal places
