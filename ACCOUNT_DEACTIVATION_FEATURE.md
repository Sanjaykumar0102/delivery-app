# Account Deactivation Feature

## âœ… Implementation Complete

When an admin deactivates a driver's account, the driver will now be redirected to a dedicated "Account Deactivated" page upon login attempt, similar to the pending approval interface.

## ðŸŽ¯ Features Implemented

### 1. **Account Deactivated Page** (`/account-deactivated`)
A dedicated page that displays when a deactivated user tries to log in.

#### Visual Design:
- ðŸš« **Red gradient theme** (matching the deactivation severity)
- **Animated icon** with shake effect
- **Clear messaging** about account status
- **Contact information** for support
- **Logout button** to return to login

#### Information Displayed:
- âœ… Why the account was deactivated
- âœ… What the user should do next
- âœ… How to contact support
- âœ… Reactivation process explanation

### 2. **Login Flow Updates**

#### Check Order:
1. **Deactivated Account** â†’ Redirect to `/account-deactivated`
2. **Pending Approval** â†’ Redirect to `/pending-approval`
3. **Rejected Application** â†’ Show error message
4. **Active & Approved** â†’ Redirect to dashboard

#### Backend Changes:
- Added `isActive` field to login response
- Returns user's active status along with other details

#### Frontend Changes:
- Login component checks `isActive` status
- Redirects to deactivated page if `isActive === false`
- Stores `isActive` in user cookies for session management

### 3. **User Experience**

#### For Deactivated Users:
```
Login Attempt â†’ Check isActive â†’ isActive = false â†’ 
Redirect to Account Deactivated Page â†’ 
Display reason & contact info â†’ 
User can logout and contact support
```

#### Page Sections:
1. **Status Header**: Clear indication of deactivation
2. **Information Cards**:
   - Why was my account deactivated?
   - What should I do?
   - Reactivation process
3. **Contact Section**: Email and phone support
4. **Logout Button**: Return to login page
