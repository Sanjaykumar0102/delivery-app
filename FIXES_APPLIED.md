# Fixes Applied to Customer Dashboard

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Cookie Parsing Error** ✅
**Problem:** `"undefined" is not valid JSON` error when accessing Customer Dashboard

**Root Cause:** 
- Cookies were being set with `secure: true` flag, which requires HTTPS
- In development (localhost with HTTP), secure cookies don't work
- This caused cookies to not be saved, resulting in `undefined` values

**Solution:**
- Removed `secure: true` flag from cookie settings in `authService.js`
- Added proper error handling in Customer Dashboard to check for undefined/invalid cookies
- Restructured cookie data to match backend response format

**Files Modified:**
1. `frontend/src/services/authService.js` - Fixed cookie settings
2. `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard/Customer/index.jsx` - Added error handling

## How to Test

### Step 1: Start Backend
```bash
cd C:\Users\sanja\Delivery_App\backend
npm start
```
**Expected Output:**
```
✅ MongoDB Connected: ...
🚀 Server running on http://localhost:5000
```

### Step 2: Start Frontend
```bash
cd C:\Users\sanja\Delivery_App\frontend
npm run dev
```
**Expected Output:**
```
VITE ready in ... ms
➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```

### Step 3: Register a Customer Account
1. Go to `http://localhost:5173/register`
2. Fill in the form:
   - Name: Test Customer
   - Email: customer@test.com
   - Password: password123
   - Role: **Customer**
3. Click "Join Now"
4. You'll be redirected to login page

### Step 4: Login
1. Enter your credentials
2. Click "Sign In"
3. You'll be redirected to Customer Dashboard

### Step 5: Test Customer Dashboard

#### Test Booking:
1. Click "📦 Book Delivery" tab
2. Enter pickup address: "123 Main St, City A"
3. Enter dropoff address: "456 Oak Ave, City B"
4. Add items:
   - Item 1: "Laptop" - Quantity: 1
   - Click "➕ Add Another Item"
   - Item 2: "Charger" - Quantity: 2
5. Click "🚀 Place Order"
6. You should see success message and auto-redirect to "My Orders"

#### Test My Orders:
1. Click "📋 My Orders" tab
2. You should see your order card with:
   - Status: "Pending" (Orange badge)
   - Pickup and dropoff addresses
   - Items list
   - Calculated fare

#### Test Tracking (After Admin Assigns Driver):
1. First, you need an admin to assign a driver
2. Then click "📍 Track Order" button on the order card
3. You'll see:
   - Order details
   - Driver information
   - Vehicle information
   - Live location (when driver updates)

---

## Next Steps

### 1. Create Admin Account
```bash
# Register with Admin role
Role: Admin
Admin Code: <your ADMIN_SECRET from .env>
```

### 2. Create Driver Account
```bash
# Register with Driver role
Role: Driver
```

### 3. Add Vehicles (Admin Dashboard)
- You'll need to build the Admin Dashboard next
- Admin can add vehicles with plate numbers and types

### 4. Assign Orders (Admin Dashboard)
- Admin assigns driver + vehicle to pending orders
- This triggers the scheduling conflict detection

### 5. Update Order Status (Driver Dashboard)
- Driver marks order as "In-Progress" when picked up
- Driver marks order as "Delivered" when completed
- Driver can update live location via Socket.io

## Important Notes

### Development vs Production
**Current Setup (Development):**
- Cookies: `secure: false` (works with HTTP)
- CORS: Allows localhost:5173
- Socket.io: Allows all origins

**For Production:**
- Set `secure: true` for cookies (requires HTTPS)
- Update CORS to your production domain
- Restrict Socket.io origins
- Use environment variables for all URLs

### Environment Variables Required
**Backend (.env):**
```env
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
ADMIN_SECRET=your_admin_code
PORT=5000
```

**Frontend (.env):**
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Not authorized, no token"
**Solution:** 
- Clear browser cookies
- Login again
- Check browser console for cookie values

### Issue: Orders not showing
**Solution:**
- Check backend is running
- Check MongoDB connection
- Check browser Network tab for API errors

### Issue: Socket.io not connecting
**Solution:**
- Ensure backend is running on port 5000
- Check browser console for connection errors
- Verify CORS settings in server.js

### Issue: "User not found" after login
**Solution:**
- Check if user exists in MongoDB
- Verify JWT_SECRET matches in .env
- Clear cookies and login again
