## üîß Integration Steps

### STEP 1: Customer Dashboard Profile

**File**: `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard/Customer/CustomerDashboard.jsx`

#### 1.1 Add Profile Tab to Navigation

Find the navigation section (around line 384-407) and add this button after the "Track" button:

```jsx
<button
  className={`nav-btn-v2 ${activeTab === "profile" ? "active" : ""}`}
  onClick={() => setActiveTab("profile")}
>
  <span className="nav-icon">üë§</span>
  <span className="nav-text">My Profile</span>
</button>
```

#### 1.2 Add Profile Section Content

Find the end of the main content area (after the track section, before `</main>`) and add the complete profile section from `CUSTOMER_PROFILE_ADDITION.jsx`.

---

### STEP 2: Driver Dashboard Profile

**File**: `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard/Driver/index.jsx`

#### 2.1 Add Profile Tab to Navigation

Find the navigation/tabs section and add this button:

```jsx
<button
  className={`tab-btn ${activeTab === "profile" ? "active" : ""}`}
  onClick={() => setActiveTab("profile")}
>
  <span className="tab-icon">üë§</span>
  <span className="tab-text">My Profile</span>
</button>
```

#### 2.2 Add Profile Section Content

Add the complete profile section from `DRIVER_PROFILE_ADDITION.jsx` after the earnings section.

---

### STEP 3: Enhanced Driver Info in Customer Orders

**File**: `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard/Customer/CustomerDashboard.jsx`

#### 3.1 Find the Orders Display Section

Look for where orders are displayed (in the "orders" tab section).

#### 3.2 Replace Simple Driver Display

Find where driver information is currently shown (usually just the name) and replace it with the enhanced driver info card from `DRIVER_INFO_COMPONENT.jsx`.

**Options:**
- **Full Card**: Use for detailed order view
- **Compact View**: Use for order list
- **Modal**: Use for popup detailed view

#### 3.3 Add Driver Info Modal (Optional but Recommended)

Add the driver info modal code at the end of the component (before the closing `</div>` of the dashboard).

---

### STEP 4: Add CSS Styles

**Files**: 
- `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard/Customer/CustomerDashboard.css`
- `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard/Driver/DriverDashboard.css`

Copy all styles from `PROFILE_AND_DRIVER_INFO_CSS.css` and add to the respective CSS files.

- **Tablet**: 768px - 1024px - Adjusted grid
- **Mobile**: < 768px - Single column layout

### Mobile Optimizations:

- Larger touch targets for buttons
- Simplified grids

---

## üéØ Call Functionality

### How It Works:

```jsx
<a href={`tel:${phoneNumber}`}>Call Driver</a>
```

**On Mobile:**
- Opens native phone dialer
- Pre-fills driver's number
- User taps to call

**On Desktop:**
- Opens default calling app (Skype, FaceTime, etc.)
- Or shows "No app configured" message
- Still useful for copying number

**Security:**
- Phone numbers from database only
- No user input for phone numbers
- Validated on backend

---

## üîí Privacy Considerations

### Driver Information Visibility:
- Only shown to customers with assigned orders
- Phone/email only visible after driver accepts
- Driver can't see customer's full info until accepted

### Data Protection:
- No sensitive data in frontend state
- Phone numbers not stored in localStorage
- All data from authenticated API calls

---

## üí° Customization Options

### Change Avatar Colors:
```css
.profile-avatar-large {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #YOUR_COLOR_1 0%, #YOUR_COLOR_2 100%);
}
```

### Modify Statistics:
Add more stats in the stats grid:
```jsx
<div className="stat-item">
  <div className="stat-icon">üéØ</div>
  <div className="stat-info">
    <span className="stat-value">{customStat}</span>
    <span className="stat-label">Custom Label</span>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Add More Profile Fields:
```jsx
<div className="profile-detail-item">
  <span className="detail-label">üè† Address</span>
  <span className="detail-value">{user?.address}</span>
</div>
```

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting
