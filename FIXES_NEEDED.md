# Critical Fixes Needed

## Issue 1: Access Denied Error (403)
**Problem**: Driver gets "Access denied" when accepting orders
**Root Cause**: The driver's role might not be properly saved in the cookie during registration/login

### Fix Required:
Check the driver registration process to ensure `role: "Driver"` is saved correctly.

**File to check**: `backend/controllers/userController.js` - `registerUser` function

Make sure when a driver registers, the response includes:
```javascript
{
  _id: driver._id,
  name: driver.name,
  email: driver.email,
  role: "Driver",  // ← This must be set
  token: generateToken(driver._id)
}
```

## Issue 2: Bike Driver Getting All Vehicle Orders
**Problem**: Driver with Bike is receiving Auto/Truck orders too
**Root Cause**: The driver's `driverDetails.vehicleType` might not be set during registration

### Fix Required:
During driver registration, ensure `driverDetails.vehicleType` is saved.

**Check**: When driver registers, the vehicleType from the form must be saved to:
```javascript
driverDetails: {
  vehicleType: "Bike"  // ← This must match the order's vehicleType
}
```

## Issue 3: Notification UI Enhancement
**Current**: Basic notification modal
**Needed**: Beautiful, modern notification with better visual hierarchy

### CSS improvements needed in `DriverDashboard.css`

## Quick Test Checklist:

1. **Test Driver Registration**:
   - Register new driver with Bike
   - Check browser console: `console.log(Cookies.get("user"))`
   - Verify it shows: `role: "Driver"` and `driverDetails.vehicleType: "Bike"`

2. **Test Vehicle Matching**:
   - Customer books Bike order
   - Only Bike drivers should get notification
   - Auto/Truck drivers should NOT get notification

3. **Test Order Acceptance**:
   - Driver clicks "Accept Order"
   - Should succeed without 403 error
   - Order should appear in "My Orders"
