# Driver Navigation & Map Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Removed "Reject Order" Button
**Problem**: Drivers could see a "Reject Order" button after accepting an order, which contradicts the business rule that drivers cannot reject orders after acceptance.

**Solution**: 
- Removed the "Reject Order" button from `OrderWorkflow.jsx`
- Only the "Arrived at Pickup" button is now shown for accepted orders
- Made the button full-width for better mobile UX

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/components/OrderWorkflow.jsx`

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Fixed Google Maps Navigation
**Problem**: Navigation wasn't properly using the driver's current location as the starting point for directions.

**Solution**: 
- **Before Pickup**: Directions from driver's current location ‚Üí pickup location
- **After Pickup**: Directions from driver's current location ‚Üí dropoff location
- Always uses driver's real-time GPS location as origin
- Opens Google Maps with proper directions mode

**How It Works**:
```javascript
// Before pickup or when "Accepted"/"Assigned"
Origin: Driver's Current Location (GPS)
Destination: Pickup Location

// After pickup ("Picked-Up" or "In-Transit")
Origin: Driver's Current Location (GPS)
Destination: Dropoff Location
```

**Google Maps URL Format**:
```
https://www.google.com/maps/dir/?api=1&origin=LAT,LNG&destination=LAT,LNG&travelmode=driving
```

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard/Driver/index.jsx`

### 3. ‚úÖ Fixed Map Display (Removed 3rd Point)
**Problem**: Map was showing 3 markers (pickup, dropoff, and driver location), which was confusing.

**Solution**: 
- Removed driver location marker from the map
- Now only shows 2 markers:
  - üü¢ **Green Marker**: Pickup location
  - üî¥ **Red Marker**: Dropoff location
- Route line shows the path between pickup and dropoff
- Map auto-fits to show both locations perfectly

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/components/OrderMap.jsx`
